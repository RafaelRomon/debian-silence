# Debian-Silence GRUB2 theme

This is my take on the [arch-silence](https://github.com/fghibellini/arch-silence) GRUB2 theme.

I just changed the arch logo for the debian logo and changed the color blue to red, all credit goes to the originial author

Note: I havent changed the helpbar yet as it required more than 5 minutes, I'll do it eventually :D
